When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You want to keep your local system up to date while pushing only the working version in the GitHub

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There could be instances where you might work on experimental changes by removing most of the existing code. By keeping the changes in sync, it would be difficult for you to keep track of your existing changes

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork - create a clone from other contributer in git hub
	clone - create a copy from git hub to local repository
	branches - create an experimental or any other working copy from the master branch

stored locally?

    It helps when we want to merge our local git repository copy to the copy in GitHub
